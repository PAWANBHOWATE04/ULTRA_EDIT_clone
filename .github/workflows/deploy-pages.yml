# Deploy static HTML/CSS site to GitHub Pages automatically on push to main.
# Place this file at: .github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml
#
# Notes:
# - This uses the official Pages actions (configure-pages, upload-pages-artifact, deploy-pages).
# - It copies site files into a `public` folder and deploys that folder.
# - Adjust the list of files/folders copied into `public` if your repo layout differs.
